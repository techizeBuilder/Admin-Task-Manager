Prompt: Sidebar & Task Creation (Role-Based Adjustments)

Design and implement dynamic role-based behavior for the Sidebar (Main Navigation) and Task Creation process. Both must adapt to the userâ€™s role to ensure focused, secure, and context-aware access.

1. Sidebar / Main Navigation (Left-Hand Vertical Menu)

The sidebar serves as the primary navigation hub and its contents vary by user role:

ðŸ”¹ Normal User (Employee)

Sidebar focus = personal productivity.

Sections:

My Tasks (only tasks assigned to self).

Quick access to task creation.

Hidden: team management, reporting dashboards, admin/billing pages.

ðŸ”¹ Manager

Sidebar expands for team oversight.

Sections:

My Tasks (own tasks).

Team Tasks (tasks assigned to direct reports).

Reporting & Analytics (team-level).

Hidden: company-wide admin features (user mgmt, billing, etc.).

ðŸ”¹ Company Admin

Sidebar = comprehensive, org-wide control.

Sections:

My Tasks

Team Tasks

Reporting & Analytics (org-wide).

Admin module with:

User Management (/admin/users)

Company Profile (/admin/org-profile)

License & Subscription Management

Status Management (custom workflows).

2. Task Creation Modal (Role-Sensitive)

Task creation must adapt dynamically to userâ€™s assignment authority & visibility permissions:

ðŸ”¹ Normal User (Employee)

Simplified flow.

Assigned To = auto-locked to self.

Visibility = hidden or locked to "Private".

Purpose = quick personal task entry.

ðŸ”¹ Manager

Delegation within team.

Assigned To dropdown includes self + direct subordinates only.

Cannot assign tasks upward or outside team (Phase I).

Visibility options scoped to team.

ðŸ”¹ Company Admin

Full flexibility.

Assigned To = searchable across entire organization.

Visibility = full access ("Private" / "Public").

Access to all advanced task creation fields.

3. Summary Table
Feature	Normal User	Manager	Company Admin
Sidebar View	My Tasks only	My Tasks + Team Tasks	Full: My, Team, Admin, Billing, User Mgmt
Task Assignment	Locked to Self	Self + Subordinates	Anyone in company
Reporting Access	Own tasks only	Own + Team	Organization-wide

âš¡ Goal: Ensure the navigation menu and task creation flow are intuitively scoped by role, reducing clutter for employees, empowering managers with team oversight, and granting admins complete organizational control.
