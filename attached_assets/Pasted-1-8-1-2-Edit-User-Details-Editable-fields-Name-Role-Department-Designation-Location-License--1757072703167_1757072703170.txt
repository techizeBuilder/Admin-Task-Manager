1.8.4. Use Case Examples
UC-8.1: Adding a New User
Priya (Company Admin) logs into Tasksetu and navigates to the Users tab in Admin Dashboard. She clicks Add User. In the modal, she enters Name = "Arjun Mehta", Email = "arjun@company.com", Role = "Manager", License = "Pro License – 12 months". She leaves Send Invitation Email checked. Upon saving, Arjun is added to the user list with status "Pending" and receives an activation link by email. License count decreases by 1.
UC-8.2: Editing User Role
Priya edits Arjun’s profile, changing his Role from "Manager" to "Company Admin". A warning modal appears. She confirms, and Arjun instantly gains admin access.
UC-8.3: Deactivating a User
Priya deactivates Rohan’s account. His status changes to "Inactive", he is locked out of the system, and his 4 active tasks display the "Owner Inactive" label.
UC-8.4: Removing a User and Freeing License
Priya removes Sneha. Before confirmation, the system prompts to reassign her 3 active tasks. Once reassigned, Sneha’s account is deleted, and her license returns to the available pool.
