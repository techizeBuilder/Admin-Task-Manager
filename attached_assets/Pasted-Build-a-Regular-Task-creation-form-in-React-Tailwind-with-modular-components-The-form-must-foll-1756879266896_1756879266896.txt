Build a Regular Task creation form in React + Tailwind with modular components. 
The form must follow the client requirements:

-----------------------
PRIMARY FIELDS (Basic Modal - always visible)
1. Task Name
   - Single line text input
   - Required, max 20 characters
   - Inline editable with live character counter (e.g., 0/20)

2. Description
   - Multiline rich text editor
   - Optional
   - Supports bullets, bold, links

3. Assigned To
   - Searchable dropdown (single select)
   - Default = Self
   - For solo users → fixed to Self
   - For org users → assign to others

4. Priority
   - Dropdown with values: Low, Medium, High, Critical
   - Required
   - Default = Low
   - When user selects priority → auto-set Due Date from backend logic (but editable)

5. Due Date
   - Date picker
   - Required
   - Default auto-filled from Priority but user can override
   - Must be today or later

6. Visibility
   - Toggle (Private / Public)
   - Required
   - Default = Private
   - For solo users → only Private shown
   - For org users → both options visible

7. Labels / Tags
   - Multi-select chips with search and inline create
   - Optional
   - Used for filtering

8. Attachments
   - Multi-file upload
   - Optional
   - Max total size = 5 MB
   - Support docs, images, PDFs

➡️ Bottom-right action buttons:
[Save] [Cancel] [More Options ▸]

-----------------------
ADVANCED FIELDS (open in "More Options" modal)
1. Reference Process
   - Searchable dropdown
   - Optional
   - Links task to predefined processes (e.g., Onboarding SOP)

2. Custom Form
   - Searchable dropdown
   - Optional
   - Attach an existing form template (cannot create new here)

3. Dependencies
   - Multi-select dropdown
   - Optional
   - Select other tasks that must be completed before this one starts

4. Task Type
   - Dropdown: Simple, Recurring, Approval
   - Required
   - Default = Simple
   - Must be extensible for future types (Milestone, Quick)

-----------------------
UI / UX Requirements:
- Use one unified Drawer or Modal (not stacked drawers).
- Primary fields always visible in the first modal.
- "More Options" opens an advanced modal for extra fields.
- Inline validation (e.g., Task Name required, max chars, Due Date ≥ today, file size ≤ 5 MB).
- Modern clean design using Tailwind (rounded corners, shadows, spacing).
- Keep code modular: separate components for PrimaryFields and AdvancedFields.
- Output should be production-ready React code with proper props, state handling, and validation.
