Prompt

Based on the provided sources, generate a Frontend Feature Specification document for the Licensing & Subscription Management module in Tasksetu. The document should focus only on the UI/UX, frontend flows, and sidebar menu placement (if applicable), without covering backend or database details.

The specification should include:

Sidebar / Navigation Integration

Define which roles (Normal User, Manager, Company Admin) see links related to Licensing & Subscription.

For Company Admins, specify where the "License & Subscription" or "Billing" menu item appears in the sidebar (/admin/license or /admin/billing).

Clarify that Regular Users and Managers have read-only access via License Management page (but no sidebar link, only contextual navigation if needed).

Frontend Pages & UI Flows
For each user-facing page, provide step-by-step flow, layout, and visual components:

Pricing & Plans Page (public marketing site view).

License Management Page (in-app summary with usage meters, trial countdown, plan comparison cards).

Purchase/Upgrade Page (plan selection, billing cycle toggle, upgrade/downgrade confirmation modal).

Billing & Invoices Page (billing summary card, payment history table with Download Invoice).

UI Components & Elements

Progress bars for usage meters (turn red when exceeding limits).

Trial countdown timer (for Explore tier).

Monthly/Yearly billing toggle with savings percentage label.

Upgrade prompts and confirmation modals (especially for downgrades with usage warnings).

Tooltip icons (ℹ️) to explain limits.

Sticky “Upgrade Now” button for mobile view.

System UX Behaviors (Frontend-only)

Always show all features in the UI, but disable/overlay upgrade prompts when limits are hit.

Inline status indicators (Active Plan, Trial Ending Soon, Past Due).

Empty state design for Billing History (“No invoices yet – upgrade to see invoices”).

Smooth role-based access differences (Admins see upgrade controls, others only see plan details).

Safeguards & Prompts (Frontend Handling)

Upgrade modal when exceeding a feature limit.

Warning modal when downgrading (compare usage vs. new plan’s lower limits).

Toast/alert messages for successful upgrade/downgrade/payment.
