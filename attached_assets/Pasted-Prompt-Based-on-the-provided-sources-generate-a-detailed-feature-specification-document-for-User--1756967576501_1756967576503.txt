Prompt:

Based on the provided sources, generate a detailed feature specification document for User Management within the Tasksetu platform. The document should clearly outline:

1. Roles & Responsibilities

Distinguish between Company Admin (organization-level control) and Tasksetu Admin / Super Admin (platform-level control).

Emphasize that Regular Users and Managers do not have user management privileges.

2. Company Admin – User Management Features

Provide step-by-step descriptions, flows, and UI elements for each function available on the /admin/users page:

Adding a New User

Flow: Add User → Modal → Required fields (Name, Email, Role, License) + optional fields (Department, Designation, Location).

Invitation logic: Pending status, activation email with 72-hour expiry.

License handling: License count decreases upon user creation.

Editing User Details

Editable fields vs non-editable fields (e.g., Email cannot be changed directly).

Special confirmation modal when changing Roles (e.g., User → Manager).

Deactivating & Reactivating a User

Deactivation logic: Inactive status, login blocked, assigned tasks remain with "Owner Inactive" label.

Reactivation restores access.

Clarify license impact (license remains assigned unless manually unassigned).

Removing a User

Permanent deletion flow.

Mandatory task reassignment before removal.

License handling: License freed immediately after removal.

Viewing User Activity

Include metrics in a summary table: Date Joined, Last Login, Assigned Tasks, Completed Tasks.

3. Tasksetu Admin (Super Admin)

Platform-level role for global user/company management.

Outline their responsibilities (support, configuration, overrides) but clarify they are not part of normal company-level workflows.

4. System Logic & Safeguards

Invitation email expiry (72 hours).

License pool adjustments on Add/Remove.

Mandatory task reassignment before deletion.

Role-change confirmation modal for access impact awareness.

Validation errors for missing fields or license unavailability.

5. UI/UX Guidelines

/admin/users should include a searchable, filterable user table.

Inline status indicators (Active, Inactive, Pending).

Contextual action menus for each user row (Edit, Deactivate/Reactivate, Remove).

Warning modals for critical actions (Deactivation, Removal, Role Change).
