Build a React + Tailwind dashboard page for Tasksetu, scoped for an Individual User (referred to as "User" or "Employee").  
This is the personal workspace at route /dashboard.  

Requirements:  
- Use React functional components.  
- Use lucide-react icons for indicators and buttons.  
- Layout: grid-based, responsive, clean with Tailwind (cards, tiles, shadows, rounded corners).  

Dashboard Sections:  

1. Frozen Quick Task Tile  
   - Permanently pinned card at top-left.  
   - Contains a "Quick Add Task" input/button.  
   - On click → open Quick Task creation screen.  
   - Quick Tasks can later be converted into full tasks (mark as “moved to task”).  

2. Task Grid (Core Section)  
   - Table/grid showing all active tasks for the logged-in user only.  
   - Columns: Title, Due Date, Priority, Status, Tags.  
   - Indicators: ⏰ Past Due, 📅 Due Today, ⚡ High Priority, 📂 Has Subtasks.  
   - Add search, filter (Due Date, Status, Priority, Tags).  
   - Support bulk actions (Complete, Postpone, Change Status).  

3. KPI Tiles (Summary Cards)  
   - ✅ Completed Today  
   - ⏳ Completed Before Due Date  
   - 🏆 Milestones Achieved  
   - 👥 Collaborator Tasks  
   - 🔴 Tasks Past Due  
   - 🔔 Approvals Awaiting  
   - Show counts with icons in neat cards.  

4. Calendar Embed  
   - Calendar view showing only user’s tasks by due date.  
   - Views: Month, Week, Day.  
   - Drag-and-drop tasks to reschedule → update due date (with audit log entry).  
   - Clicking a date opens “Create Task” modal pre-filled with that date.  

5. Pinned / Favorite Tasks Section  
   - Show user’s pinned tasks in a horizontal list or card section.  
   - Quick access to open these tasks.  

6. Prominent Create Task Button  
   - A floating or top-right button (`+ Create Task`).  
   - Opens the Task Creation Modal.  

Props:  
- Component name: `UserDashboard`.  
- Accepts `tasks`, `quickTasks`, `pinnedTasks`, and `userStats` props for rendering.  
- Example:  
  ```jsx
  <UserDashboard 
    tasks={tasks} 
    quickTasks={quickTasks} 
    pinnedTasks={pinnedTasks} 
    userStats={stats} 
  />
