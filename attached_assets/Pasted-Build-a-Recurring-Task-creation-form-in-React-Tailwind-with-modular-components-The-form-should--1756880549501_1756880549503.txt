Build a Recurring Task creation form in React + Tailwind with modular components. 
The form should extend the Regular Task form with a "Recurring Task" toggle. 
When toggle = ON → disable Due Date field in base form and show Recurrence Panel.

-------------------------------------
PRIMARY BEHAVIOR:
- A Recurring Task = Normal task + recurrence metadata
- Only ONE assignee allowed
- Contributors allowed freely (read/comment/notify)
- Licensing limits must be enforced (e.g., Explore plan: 1 pattern, Plan: 10 patterns, Execute/Optimize: unlimited)

-------------------------------------
FIELDS & CONTROLS (Recurrence Panel):
1. Pattern Type (radio, required)
   Options: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, Custom

2. Repeat Every (number input, required)
   Default = 1 (e.g., every 1 day/week/month/year)

3. Pattern-specific selectors (conditional rendering):
   - Daily:
     → Every N days
   - Weekly:
     → Every N weeks
     → Days of week multi-select (Mon..Sun) [required]
   - Monthly:
     → Every N months
     → Mode: 
         a) By date(s): multi-select day numbers 1–31
         b) By position (optional MVP+): first/second/third/last + weekday
         c) Specific date (e.g., every 5th month on 15th)
   - Yearly:
     → Every N years
     → Month(s) multi-select + Day
   - Custom:
     → Calendar multi-select for ad-hoc dates

4. Start Date/Time
   - Default = Today, 09:00 local time of assignee
   - Cannot be in the past (unless Admin override)

5. End Condition (radio, required)
   - Never ends
   - Ends after N occurrences (number input, N ≥ 1)
   - Ends by Date (date ≥ start date)

6. Assignment & People
   - Assignee: single select (enforce role rules)
     • Individual user → fixed to self
     • Manager/Admin → can assign to others
   - Contributors: multi-select (optional)

7. Visibility
   - Inherit Task defaults (Private/Public)

8. Notes / Instruction
   - Free text field (optional)

-------------------------------------
UI / UX REQUIREMENTS:
- When Recurring = ON → 
  → Hide/disable Due Date in base form
  → Show Recurrence Panel
- Pattern Type switch should reset irrelevant controls
- Show inline errors:
  • Weekly pattern → require at least one weekday
  • Monthly → cannot select By Date(s) + By Position together
  • End date < Start date → block with error
- Bottom of panel → “Preview next 5 dates” (live updates when user changes controls)
- Show human-readable summary, e.g.:
  “Every Monday & Wednesday at 10:00, starting 02 Jun 2025, ends after 12 occurrences.”
- Add 🔁 badge next to Recurring Tasks

-------------------------------------
VALIDATION & ERROR HANDLING:
- Required fields must block Save
- Conflicting selections → block with red helper text
- License enforcement → before save, check recurrence limit
  • If exceeded → block save + show Upgrade CTA
- Unauthorized assignment → block + role-specific message
- Preview warning: if pattern yields 0 results in next 12 months → show warning

-------------------------------------
OUTPUT:
- Production-ready React component with Tailwind
- Code modular: 
  • `RecurringTaskPanel` component handles recurrence fields
  • Reuses base `TaskForm` fields
- Validation inline with helper text
- Save/Cancel buttons at bottom of unified drawer/modal
