You're absolutely right! I created the User Management functionality but I'm using static data stored in component state instead of a proper data table structure. Looking at your requirements document, I can see you need a proper table-based approach for demonstrating the user management features. Let me create a proper user data management structure that follows the data schema you provided and implements all the behaviors mentioned in your document.

Perfect! The project has been restarted successfully. The server is running on port 5000 with MongoDB connected. Now you can: 1. **Login** to the application with your admin credentials 2. **Navigate to "User Management"** in the sidebar (should now show correctly without "Invite Users") 3. **Access** the complete User Management system at `/admin/users` The application is ready to use with: - Clean sidebar showing only "User Management" - Fixed dropdown transparency for the three-dot menus - Complete user management functionality with license pool tracking - All the demo users from your specification ready for testing You should now be able to test the full User Management flow without any routing issues or duplicate menu items!

I've built a comprehensive Profile Management system with role-based functionality. Here's what's implemented:

✓ Complete profile schema with all specified fields
✓ Role-based field restrictions (email read-only for org users)
✓ Phone number validation (10-15 digits)
✓ Profile picture upload with size/format validation
✓ Password change functionality with strength validation
✓ Organization info management (department, manager selector)
✓ Access & roles section (read-only badges)
✓ Security info (last login, join date)
✓ Notification preferences with toggles

The profile can be accessed via:

Avatar dropdown → "Edit Profile"
Sidebar → Settings → Profile
Could you test the profile management functionality and let me know if it meets your requirements?

Build a React (with Tailwind + shadcn/ui) Profile Management UI based on the following requirements:

Sections: Basic Info, Organization Info, Access & Roles, Security, Preferences.

Fields:

Basic Info → Profile Picture (upload with preview, jpg/png ≤ 2MB), Full Name (editable), Email (read-only for org users), Phone (10–15 digits validation).

Organization Info → Org Name (auto-filled for org, editable text for individuals), Department (optional), Manager (optional select).

Access & Roles → Assigned Role (User / Manager / Admin), License Tier, Date of Joining, License Expiry (all read-only).

Security → Last Login (timestamp, read-only), 2FA Enabled (toggle switch), Change Password (button → modal with current + new + confirm).

Preferences → Time Zone (dropdown, default to browser/IST), Notification Settings (toggles for email, in-app, push).

Role-specific behavior:

User → can only edit picture, name, phone, preferences.

Manager → same as User + view Department/Manager fields.

Admin → can see/edit everything except license tier and expiry.

UI Behavior:

Success/error messages inline under each section.

Drag & drop or click-to-upload for profile picture, with preview + validation.

Responsive design (grid on desktop, stacked on mobile).

Use Tailwind + shadcn/ui components (Card, Input, Switch, Select, Button).

Frontend only (no backend integration).

Add toggles for 2FA and notifications.

I can see the toggle switches might not be visible due to styling issues. Let me first restart the workflow to fix the port conflict, then check and improve the styling for the notification toggle switches.


Restarted Start application
Now let me check the current CSS styling and improve the toggle switch visibility by adding better theme colors and styling:


Opened client/src/index.css

Opened client/src/components/ui/switch.tsx
Now I need to add proper CSS variables for the switch component to make it more visible. Let me update the index.css with better theme styles for the switch component:


Edited client/src/index.css
Now let me update the Switch component with better styling to make it more visible with the project's theme colors:


Edited client/src/components/ui/switch.tsx
Perfect! I've now enhanced the toggle switch styling with much better visibility and theme integration. Let me also add some additional CSS improvements to make sure the notification settings section looks great:


Opened client/src/index.css
Let me add specific notification settings styling to make them even more polished:


Edited client/src/index.css
Now let me update the EditProfile component to use these new styling classes for a much better visual appearance:


Edited client/src/pages/EditProfile.jsx
I need to fix the CSS error. Let me remove the problematic @apply border-border line:


Edited client/src/index.css

Restarted Start application
Perfect! Now the toggle switches should be visible and beautifully styled. Let me take a quick screenshot to verify the notification settings are working properly:
