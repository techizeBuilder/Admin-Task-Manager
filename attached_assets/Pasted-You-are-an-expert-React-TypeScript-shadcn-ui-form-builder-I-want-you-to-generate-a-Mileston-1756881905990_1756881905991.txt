You are an expert React + TypeScript + shadcn/ui form builder. 
I want you to generate a **Milestone Task Form** for my task management app. 
This form should follow **clean code, modularity, and maintainability**. 
Each task type (Regular, Recurring, Approval, Milestone) will have its **own component**. 
This prompt is for the **Milestone Task Form** only.  

### Functional Requirements:
- **Toggle**: "Is Milestone?" → when ON, show milestone-specific fields.
- **Milestone Type (required)**: Dropdown with options → `Standalone`, `Linked`.
- **Task Name (required)**: Input, max length = 80 chars, live counter.
- **Description (optional)**: Rich text editor (support bold, bullets, links).
- **Due Date (required)**: Date picker. Must be ≥ today.  
  If Milestone Type = `Linked`, default to latest due date among dependencies.
- **Assigned To (required)**: Single-select dropdown. Default = Self.  
- **Milestone Type Specifics**:
  - If `Standalone`: No dependency field.
  - If `Linked`: Show **multi-select search dropdown** for tasks/sub-tasks.  
    Validation: Cannot select milestone itself.  
- **Priority (optional)**: Dropdown → Low, Medium, High, Critical (default Medium).
- **Visibility (required)**: Toggle → Private/Public (inherits from parent project if exists).
- **Collaborators (optional)**: Multi-select chips for notifications on achievement.
- **Status Handling**:
  - Default Status = Not Started.  
  - Cannot mark achieved until status = Ready to Mark.  
- **Restrictions**:
  - No subtasks allowed under milestone.  
  - Cannot link milestone to another milestone (avoid recursion).  
  - Milestone cannot be recurring.  

### UI / UX Requirements:
- Use **⭐ icon** in header to indicate milestone mode.  
- Show **inline validation** for missing/invalid fields:
  - Empty Task Name → "Milestone name is required."
  - Due Date < Today → "Due date must be today or later."
  - Self-linking → "Circular dependency not allowed."
- Show tooltip on hover: milestone rules & dependency summary.  
- Buttons: **[Save] [Cancel]** bottom right.  

### Output Requirements:
- Generate a clean, reusable React component named `MilestoneTaskForm.tsx`.  
- Use **shadcn/ui** form primitives (Form, Input, Select, Toggle, DatePicker, etc).  
- Use **lucide-react icons** where needed (⭐, calendar, users).  
- Validation with **react-hook-form + zod** schema.  
- Component should be future-extensible.
