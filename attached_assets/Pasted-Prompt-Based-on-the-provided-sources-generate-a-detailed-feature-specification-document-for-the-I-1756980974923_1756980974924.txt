Prompt:

Based on the provided sources, generate a detailed feature specification document for the Invite User functionality within the Tasksetu platform. The document should clearly outline:

Roles & Permissions

Clarify that only Company Admins have the ability to invite new users.

Emphasize that Regular Users and Managers do not have this privilege.

Note that new Company Admins are prompted to invite users during onboarding.

Invitation Flow (Step-by-Step)

Start from the User Management section (/admin/users).

Describe the “Add User” button → Invite User Modal flow.

Mandatory fields: Name, Email (unique), Role, License.

Optional fields: Department, Designation, Location.

Checkbox option for “Send Invitation Email” (default checked).

Post-invite: user created in Pending state until they accept.

Invitation Email

Subject: “You’ve been invited to Tasksetu”.

Content: Personalized message with inviter and company name.

Includes an activation link (72-hour expiry).

System Logic & Safeguards

Email must be unique across platform.

License count decreases immediately when invitation is sent.

Invitation expires after 72 hours (user can request resend).

Pending users visible in User Management with status.

Reactivation after 90 days triggers a resend of the invite.

Bulk Invitations

Support for uploading multiple users (CSV or form with multiple rows).

Each user in bulk invite must pass validation (unique email, license availability).

UI/UX Guidelines

Invite User Modal: clean form with validation + dropdowns for Role & License.

User Table: status column showing Active / Inactive / Pending.

Inline error states (e.g., “Email already exists”, “No licenses available”).

Warning modal if license pool is exhausted.

Deliverables should include:

Feature Overview

User Stories & Flows (Admin invites single user, bulk invite, pending user accepts, expired invite handling).

UI Elements (buttons, modal, status indicators).

System Logic (license impact, email expiry, reactivation behavior).
