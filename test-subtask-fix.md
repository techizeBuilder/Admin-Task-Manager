# Subtask Creation Fix Test

## Issue Identified
The error `"Cast to ObjectId failed for value \"1\" (type string) at path \"_id\" for model \"Task\""` was caused by:

### Root Cause
1. **TaskActionsDropdown.jsx** was passing `task.id` (integer like `1`) instead of the full `task` object to `openSubtaskDrawer()`
2. The backend expects MongoDB ObjectId format (like `507f1f77bcf86cd799439011`) for the parent task ID
3. Frontend was sending integer IDs that can't be cast to ObjectId

### Fix Applied
- **Line 91 in TaskActionsDropdown.jsx**: Changed from `openSubtaskDrawer(task.id)` to `openSubtaskDrawer(task)`
- **Added comprehensive debugging** in SubtaskForm to trace ID format issues
- **Enhanced logging** in AllTasks.jsx to show task ID mapping process

## Test Steps
1. Open the app and navigate to All Tasks
2. Click on the Actions dropdown for any task (three dots menu)
3. Click "Create Sub-task"
4. Fill out the subtask form
5. Click "Create Subtask" button
6. Check console logs for debugging information
7. Verify the subtask is created successfully without "Cast to ObjectId failed" error

## Expected Results
- ✅ No "Cast to ObjectId failed" error
- ✅ Console shows proper ObjectId being sent to API
- ✅ Subtask created successfully
- ✅ Form closes automatically after creation
- ✅ Task list updates with new subtask

## Debug Console Output Expected
